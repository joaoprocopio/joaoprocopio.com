  I'm a product-minded engineer focused on building software that makes a real
  impact. I like working across the full stack, but I'm most at home on the
  frontend — where design meets engineering and small details shape the entire
  user experience.

  Most recently, I was the third engineer at
  <a class="text-foreground" href="https://villafact.com">Villafact</a>, an
  early-stage startup where I worked directly with the CEO to translate business
  vision into shipped products. Before that, I built AI-driven agricultural
  platforms at
  <a class="text-foreground" href="https://moray.ai">Moray</a> and shipped features
  across a hybrid mobile app serving millions of travelers at
  <a class="text-foreground" href="https://www.buser.com.br">Buser</a>. These
  experiences — from startups to high-growth companies — shaped how I think
  about building products: with full ownership, close collaboration, and a bias
  toward impact.

  My first contact with code was following a Python tutorial to send WhatsApp
  messages with the Twilio SDK. After dozens of stack traces and Stack Overflow
  answers, seeing that message come through felt like magic. That feeling still
  drives me today.
