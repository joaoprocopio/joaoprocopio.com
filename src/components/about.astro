  I'm a product-minded engineer focused on building software that makes a real
  impact. I like working across the full stack, but I'm most at home on the
  frontend — where design meets engineering and small details shape the entire
  user experience.

<p>
  Most recently, I was the third engineer at
  <ExternalLink class="text-foreground" href={VILLAFACT_EXPERIENCE.url}
    >Villafact</ExternalLink
  >, an early-stage startup where I worked directly with the CEO to translate
  business vision into shipped products. Before that, I built AI-driven
  agricultural platforms at
  <ExternalLink class="text-foreground" href={MORAY_EXPERIENCE.url}
    >Moray</ExternalLink
  > and shipped features across a hybrid mobile app serving millions of travelers
  at
  <ExternalLink class="text-foreground" href={BUSER_EXPERIENCE.url}
    >Buser</ExternalLink
  >. These experiences — from startups to high-growth companies — shaped how I
  think about building products: with full ownership, close collaboration, and a
  bias toward impact.

  My first contact with code was following a Python tutorial to send WhatsApp
  messages with the Twilio SDK. After dozens of stack traces and Stack Overflow
  answers, seeing that message come through felt like magic. That feeling still
  drives me today.
