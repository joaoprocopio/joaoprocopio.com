  <Typography>
    Always seeking to make an impact in the real world through building
    software.
  </Typography>

  <Typography>
    From a young age, my interests always gravitated toward technology - it's an
    innate interest that has always been present. However, there was a specific
    moment when I began to be interested not just in technology itself, but in
    the process of building it.
  </Typography>

  <Typography>
    I watched a video of someone creating a Python service to send WhatsApp
    messages using the Twilio SDK, and for someone with no programming
    experience, seeing this brought me enormous excitement and made me want to
    understand how it worked.
  </Typography>

  <div>
    <Typography>
      I set up the tools on my machine and followed the step-by-step tutorial.
      After dozens of stack traces and having the canonical developer
      experience:
    </Typography>

    <ol class="mt-2 list-inside list-decimal [&>li+li]:mt-0.5">
      <Typography variant="body" element="li"> Copy the error </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body" element="li">
        Paste it into Google and click the first Stack Overflow result
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body" element="li">
        Jump straight to the answer
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body" element="li"> Stare at the code </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body" element="li">
        Manage to solve it (optional)
      </Typography>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <Typography>
    In the end, I succeeded. Seeing it work with the message coming through gave
    me immense satisfaction — it was my first practical contact with code, and
    it felt like magic.
  </Typography>

  <Typography>
    Since then, learning and facing increasingly bigger challenges has become a
    passion. I enjoy diving into unknown problems and, even without much initial
    information, reaching a complete solution. Each new learning experience is
    another piece that expands my vision of what's possible to achieve with
    technology.
  </Typography>

  <div>
    <Typography>
      Currently, I have experience with these programming languages:
    </Typography>

    <ol class="mt-2 list-inside list-disc [&>li+li]:mt-0.5">
      <Typography variant="body" element="li">
        JavaScript and TypeScript
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body" element="li"> Python </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body" element="li"> Dart </Typography>
    </ol>

    <Typography class="mt-2">
      I'm always interested in learning more languages, and I'm currently
      studying Go and Rust.
    </Typography>
  </div>

  <div>
    <Typography>
      I've also worked with various frameworks, such as:
    </Typography>

    <ol class="mt-2 list-inside list-disc [&>li+li]:mt-0.5">
      <Typography variant="body" element="li"> Vue </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body" element="li"> Nuxt </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body" element="li"> React </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body" element="li"> Django </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body" element="li"> Flutter </Typography>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <Typography>
    Although I like frameworks, I believe each project has its own needs, and
    often, I prefer the simplicity of working with just the basics, without
    frameworks, in personal projects.
  </Typography>

  <Typography>
    Today, as a Software Engineer, I feel I have the ability to design and
    develop complete applications, participating in every step of the
    engineering process.
  </Typography>

  <Typography>
    My focus is to always make the maximum possible impact on every product that
    I work on.
